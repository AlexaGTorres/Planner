Class: Andvanced Java Topics\
Date Started: December 11, 2022\
Description: 	I would like to create a planner app. I will be learning how to accurately display dates, such as the current date, and store information the user inputs onto specific dates. I want to make it so you can open the calendar portion of the app and you can put something you need to do on that specific day. On another part of the app I would like to have a todo list made up of the things put on the calendar or the user input.
